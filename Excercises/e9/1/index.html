	<div class="jo"> "Christmas <b>won't</b> be Christmas without any presents," grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.</div>

	<div class="meg">"It's so <i>dreadful</i> to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.</div>

	<div class="beth"><b>"We've</b> got Father <i>and</i> Mother, and each <u>other</u>," said Beth contentedly from her corner. </div>
