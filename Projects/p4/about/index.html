		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>When I was a wee lad, I was a MASSIVE transformers fan.  I managed to wring a LOT 
			of figures out of my parents' wallets, and they've been laying around for quite some 
			time.</p>

			<p>For the sake of older, simpler times, I decided to yank out a few figures and 
			photograph them for the sake of this project. As I was doing so, however, I was picking 
			out a disproportionate of decepticons; TEN of them in fact. That's when I asked the 
			question; why not?</p>

			<p>These are ten decepti-toys I scrounged up during my fateful basement crawl. We'll look 
			over their positives, negatives, and relation to my personal story.</p>
