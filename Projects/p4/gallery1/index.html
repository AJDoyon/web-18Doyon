		<h1>Sailbacked Frontline: UNDERMINE</h1>

		<p>(Scout Class, $6.99, 2005)</p>	
			<ul class="bullets">	
				<li>(+)Has good sculpting and an appealing color scheme</li>
				<li>(+)Is solidly articulated, especially in the legs, as a result of the transformation</li>
				<li>(-)Has awkward hands as a result of their moonlight as a dino head, which are incapable of holding any weapons in the line beyond his own</li>
				<li>(-)His Cyber-key gimmick, while stylish, is somewhat unwieldy, especially in beast mode</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This little squirt is meant to be purchased as one of a duo, so naturally he was the only one of the two I got. I remember messing around with his legs a lot, since they were basically hinge city. His "cyber key" gimmick, a large blade that comes out of his head/sail upon activation, seemed more like an intimidation tactic than anything, since trying to have him actually stab anything with it was an adventure in and of itself. And while his hands are incompatible with everyone else's weapons, they're surprisingly expressive given their nature as a mouth.</p>

		<p>Undermine would be the little brother of the squad; the small fry with big ambitions, obsessed with proving his strength. He was meant to have died quite some time ago; he was an expendable meant to have caused havoc during a siege before he eventually croaked. He inexplicably survived, however, and joined this little gang to keep his fighting streak. His childish ambitions has endeared himself to some, but he's typically the butt of most jokes among the squad.</p>
