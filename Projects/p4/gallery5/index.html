		<h1>Ascending Ariel Assailant: THUNDERCRACKER</h1>

		<p>(Deluxe Class, $9.99, 2005)</p>	
			<ul class="bullets">	
				<li>(+)Has a unique robot mode, at least when it comes to his left arm</li>
				<li>(-)His cyber key gimmick just makes things awkward</li>
				<li>(-)That left arm of his is nearly impossible to keep plugged in</li>
			</ul>
		<p>One of the core cast of baddies from the show! This guy has some fond memories; I was just getting started with this horrible hoarding streak, and this guy was among the first of my prisoners. I can remember even now that getting him to stick together in robot mode was a real pain. It helps him stick out, I suppose...</p>

		<p>Thundercracker is the lone decepticon among the squad who can fly, and this has given him a wheelbarrow of responsibilities. Air support, supply runs on the cheap, reconnaissance... pick any two. Even through the stress of all of this, however, Thundercracker proves to be only sane man of the squad.</p>

		<p>At least, that the case for <i>one</i> side of him; he suffers from a major glitch that gives him to distinct personalities. He's a collected and friendly, if irritable guy in robot mode, but a cackling, triggerhappy yet cowardly psychopath in vehicle mode. His peers prefer the latter mode.</p>
