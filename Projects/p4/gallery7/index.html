		<h1>Sovereign of Skullduggery: CANNONBALL</h1>

		<p>(Deluxe Class, $9.99, 2005)</p>	
			<ul class="bullets">	
				<li>(+)Is quite pretty, and has tampographs unlike what we usually see</li>
				<li>(-)Has easily the most teeth-grindingly infuriating transformation of the the entire lot, involving big chunks having to slide around tiny panels</li>
				<li>(-)His cyber-key gimmick is totally LAME</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The guy I bought SOLELY because he's a repaint of a character who was of ACTUAL relevance. Fun times!</p>

		<p>I have no idea how my kid-self was able to tolerate this guy; his transformation is actual torture. His template was a medic, so even though he's supposed to be a pirate, his accessories were a claw and hammer-head... both of which I've long since lost. Also, his cyber-key gimmick is shoulder cannons... the same as Dirt Boss in robot mode. Whee.</p>

		<p>An assasin by trade, Cannonball specializes in toxins, subterfuge and easy kills. His inner workings are specifically tuned for silent driving and quiet steps, all while having a dedicated interface he can view for all of his killing needs. Cannonball himself is actually a loud, bombastic party man, which typically has him turn off his voice altogehter for his work.</p>
