		<h1>Siren of the Squad: THUNDERBLAST</h1>

		<p>(Deluxe Class, $9.99, 2006)</p>	
			<ul class="bullets">	
				<li>(+)Has some of the best articulation of the line, being incredibly flexible for all manner of silly poses</li>
				<li>(+)Has an impressive weapon that still works with other figures, despite the unconventional way she holds it</li>
				<li>(-)Her transformation is literally just her alt-mode splitting in half, and it's quite fiddly.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The circumstances being purchasing her are completely uninteresting. What IS interesting is that I was <i>dead convinced</i> that her boat-mode would actually float, and thus took her to many a pool and bathtub. She never floated, however, and I feel stupid for <i>ever</i> thinking such a thing would be possible.</p>

		<p>The founder and commanding officer of the Decepticrew. A master of military strategy and psychological warfare, Thunderblast uses her brain to whip her underlings into shape and her targets into a fine red paste. Her personality is unapologetically flamboyant, a poetically-driven girly girl which is a fine hiding place for her guile and genius.</p>
